#**COINBASE**

## Overview and Origin

* **Name of company**: Coinbase

* **When was the company incorporated?:** Coinbase was incorporated in June 2012. 

* **Who are the founders of the company?:**  Brian Armstrong & Fred Ehrsam

* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?:** According to their own website Coinbase was built around the idea of "with the radical idea that anyone, anywhere, should be able to easily and securely send and receive Bitcoin."

* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?:**  Coinbase originally received a 150,000 USD cash infusion from a startup incubator program to get the program off the ground. Later on in May 2013 they received a 5 million USD investment from a venture capital firm, Union Square Ventures, then in December of the same year a 25 million USD investment from Union Square Ventures, along with two new VC firms, Andresssen Horowitz and Ribbit Capital.

## Business Activities:

* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?:** Coinbase's goal is to provide a more centralised place for consumers to purchase and invest in cryptocurrencies. One intimidating factor for the common man, as it were, is how to get involved in crypto. So Coinbase saw a way to make it less intimidating and create an easy to access app so people can use it to buy/invest in crypto. 

* **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?):** The intended customer of Coinbase is "anyone, anywhere.", according to their own website. Also according to their website they have 56 million verified users in over 100 countries with 335 Billion USD in "quarterly volume traded". The unfair advantage that they seem to utilize is that they are they are the crypto wallet that can be accessed in the largest amount of countries in the world. Other crypto wallet companies are still tryring to break into different markets that Coinbase already has a foothold in.   

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.):** Coinbase runs entirely over enccrypted SSL and uses AES-256 encryption for the wallets and private keys of its customers. Security is from the system to the employee, as employees are required to encrypt their own harddrives, pass a background check and such. Other than that Coinbase seems to have the same blockchain tech everyone else needs to have for proper crypto use. 


## Landscape:

* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?:** Coinbase is *based* in BlockChains and Cryptocurrencies. 

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?:**  The main drive has been to increase access to cryptocurrencies to more people while making sure their transactions are secure. While people can still mine cryptocurrencies the main trends and innovations of Coinbase and its likeminded competitors is to increase accessibility and security with regards to their platforms. Coinbase keeps the crypto wallets offline so that they cannot be hacked into and stolen. Investopedia says that Coinbase has one of the stronger security systems for cryptocurrency wallets. 

* **What are the other major companies in this domain?:**  According to Benzinga there are several other companies competeting with Coinbase in the Crypto domain. Voyaher digital that trades in over 50 cryptocurrencies and advertise that they have more cryptocurrencies than Coinbase. Binance is another crypto wallet that claims to move over 2 Billion USD in average daily volume and 1.4 million trades. Gemini is another large cypto exchange and is looking to expand. So there are several strong competitors to Coinbase.    


## Results

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?:** Sofar Coinbase is the biggest cryptocurrency wallet on the market. They seem to have helped bring crypto into the mainstream for beginning investors. While one of cryptocurrency's big draws is being decentralized, having no "Federal Reserve" as it were people still want to have something they can trust and having a large company like Coinbase that protects and secures people's crypto assests helps add legitmacy to the whole crypto game.  

* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?:** The core metrics to judge bitcoin wallet companies are the number of transactions, amount of money moved, and the amount of accounts.  

* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?:** So far Coinbase is the dominate wallet in the crypto field. They have been one of the crypto wallets to make an IPO and be tradable on the stock market, NASDAQ specifically. Coinbase leads the rest of its competitors in the metrics that these companies are judged by. The only one that any of the competitors seem to have a lead in is the different kinds of cryptocurrencies able to be traded on the different apps. 


## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!):** Coinbase seems to already have a clear idea on what they're doing as they are the most successful crypto wallet. So anything I would try to pitch to them would be improvements in security, user friendliness, or anything that built trust in Coinbase as the best "base" for the consumers coins.  

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?:** The whole idea of Coinbase is to provide an easy way for people to invest in and trade cryptocoins. So any technology improvements that I would pitch would probably be a technology that improves security, any User UI with the app, or the ability for them to cash out whenever they can. 

* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?:** It would likely build on what Coinbase had in place unless a change in security required a teardown of the whole system. 

* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?:** Any technology that improves the usability and security of a cryptocurrency wallet is a technology that the crptocurrency wallet company needs to embrace. They need to have trust in the company. We can see that in the loss of trust in RobinHood after their Gamestop fiasco. People moved their assests out of their trades.
